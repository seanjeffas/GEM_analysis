## Code Organization

The src directory files hold functions used for processing the APV data. These files hold the pedestal calculations, APV data structs, and GEM map decoding.

## Efficiency Analysis

 The following 'GEM_luminosity.C' script will analyze the luminosity runs and show how each module performed with beam current.

## Common Mode Studies

'APV_visualize.C' shows an event display of the runs and can be used to visually check how the CM methods are working.

'CM_method_analysis.C' will analyze the CM for thousands of events and compare their performance.

## Negative Signal Studies

'neg_signal.C' will look at the negative signal ADC distributions for different beam currents.

'neg_track_study.C' will display lots of information for negative and positive signals and make comparisons between the two.
